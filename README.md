To start the server, assuming you have already installed the necessary dependencies (`express`, `cors`, etc.):

1. **Server Start Command**: Use `node` command to start your server file. Assuming your server file is named `server.js`, the command would be:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. **How to Run**:
   - Navigate to the directory where your `server.js` file is located using the terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the server using the command mentioned above (`node server.js`).

This command will start your Express server on port 5000, as specified in your code (`const PORT = 5000;`). Adjust the file name (`server.js`) if your server file has a different name.
